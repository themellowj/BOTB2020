# Project Chronos 

This repository contains: Files and links from Cheyney University [Battle of the Brains](https://hbcubattleofthebrains.com/) team in 2020. The event was a 24 hour competition. 

Our task was to improve players performance by building wearables that can also be linked to companies revenue while improving player tracking.
